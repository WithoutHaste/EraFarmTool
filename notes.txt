top requirements
====================
- login
  - if there are zero Admin users, first Admin must be setup via bash shell command running a PHP script (takes in username/password and runs same "add user" command as site calls
  - Admins can use site to add new users, can set other users to be Admins
  - backend does not allow dropping to zero Admins, but if that somehow happens then the first Admin can be added via shell command again, or a similar command can upgrade an existing User to Admin level
- allow inputing scheduled tasks
- show list of scheduled tasks
- can send notifications by sms/text
- send notification on the day of the task
- neither email not sms integration is required to use the system

- keep a How To linked from the Readme updated, as if a new admin is setting up the system from scratch



known issues
- clean up how the pages are composed - which require simple auth, which require admin auth
- saving a line of record does not ensure there are no end-line chars
- html/js injection protection when displaying content to user
- need an admin user page for adding more users
- falling behind on dataaccess unit tests
